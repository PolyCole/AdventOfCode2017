# AdventOfCode2017
My solutions for the 2017 Advent of Code, written in Java.

## What is Advent of Code?
The about page of https://adventofcode.com/2017/about describes AoC as, "Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."

## Project Structure
Each day is contained within a single folder. Inside the folder is the input for the day as well as one or two Java files (depending on the problem) containing the solution. Also in the folder is the README file that contains the problem for that day.

## Version
This code is written in Java 9.
